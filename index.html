	<p>
		Currently, I am working in the <a href="https://visualai.princeton.edu/">Princeton Visual AI lab</a>, 
		advised by <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~olgarus/">Professor Olga Russakovsky</a>.
		Previously, I also worked in the group of <a href="http://web.math.princeton.edu/~amits/">Professor Amit Singer</a>, 
		with <a href="https://mosco.github.io/">Amit Moscovich.</a>
		In the past, I interned on the Android Camera Machine Intelligence team at Google 
		and also spent a great summer at the Williams College <a href="https://math.williams.edu/small/">SMALL REU</a>.
	</p>
	<p>In my spare time, I make <a href="https://sharonxzart.tumblr.com">art</a> and short <a href="https://vimeo.com/szhang25">videos</a>. 
		I also enjoy swimming and running (still working on enjoying biking though).</p>

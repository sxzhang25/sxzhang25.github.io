	<h2>about</h2>
	<p>I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at Princeton University studying mathematics and computer science. 
		I'm interested in the areas of <b>computer vision</b>, <b>geometric processing</b> and <b>creative technologies</b>. My current research involves applying spectral analysis techniques to manifold learning.</p>
	<p>This past summer, I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at Google on the Android camera machine intelligence team.</p>
	<p>I make <a href="https://sharonxzart.tumblr.com">art</a> and <a href="https://vimeo.com/szhang25">videos</a> in my spare time. I also enjoy swimming and long-distance running.</p>

	<h2>about</h2>
	<p>I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at Princeton University studying mathematics and computer science.</p>
	<p>My interests are in <b>computer vision</b> and <b>machine learning</b>. My current research involves applying spectral analysis techniques for 3D reconstruction problems in cryo-electron microscopy.</p>
	<p>During the summer of 2020, I am working as a Software Engineering Intern at Google on the Pixel camera intelligence team.</p>
	<p>I enjoy <a href="https://sharonxzart.tumblr.com">painting</a> and <a href="https://vimeo.com/szhang25">animating</a>. In my free time I run, swim, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/52.loaves/">bake bread</a>.</p>

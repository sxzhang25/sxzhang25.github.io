			<h1>about</h1>
			<p>Hi! 👋 I'm a PhD student at Stanford University advised by 
				<a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/~maneesh/">Maneesh Agrawala</a> in the Stanford Graphics + HCI group. 
				<p>
				My research focuses on building systems to help people create and edit visual content. 
				More specifically, I'm interested in tools that operate between different visual representations (pixels are for machines, not people!).
				Recently, I've also been interested in improving on the trial-and-error status quo of working with generative models. 
				<p>
				Previously, I received a B.A. in mathematics from Princeton University, where I was fortunate to work with 
				<a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~olgarus/">Olga Russakovsky</a>,  
				<a href="http://web.math.princeton.edu/~amits/">Amit Singer</a>, and 
				 <a href="https://mosco.github.io/">Amit Moscovich.</a>
				My work is supported by the <a href="https://brown.columbia.edu/">Brown Institute for Media Innovation</a> and an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

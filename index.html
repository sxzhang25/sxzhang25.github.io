<div class="about-row">
	<p>This past summer, I worked as a software engineering intern at Google on the Android camera machine intelligence team. 
		Currently, I am advised by <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~olgarus/">Professor Olga Russakovsky</a> in the <a href="https://visualai.princeton.edu/">Princeton Visual AI lab.</a></p>
	<p>I make <a href="https://sharonxzart.tumblr.com">art</a> and <a href="https://vimeo.com/szhang25">videos</a> in my spare time. I also enjoy swimming and running (still working on biking).</p>

		Previously, I completed my undergrad at Princeton University, where I had the pleasure of working with 
		<a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~olgarus/">Olga Russakovsky</a> in the 
		<a href="https://visualai.princeton.edu/">Princeton Visual AI lab</a>, as well as with

	 	<a href="https://mosco.github.io/">Amit Moscovich.</a>
	</p>
	<p>In my spare time, I make <a href="https://sharonxzart.tumblr.com">art</a> and short <a href="https://vimeo.com/szhang25">videos</a>. 
		I also enjoy swimming, running and biking.</p>

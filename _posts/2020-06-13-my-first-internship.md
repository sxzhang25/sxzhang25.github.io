I just finished week two of my first internship. Between working remotely with a three-hour time difference from the rest of my team, receiving equipment nearly a week late, and dealing with the pandemic and social unrest and all the other things happening in this election year, it's been quite an experience. 

<!--excerpt-->

This summer, I'm working at Google as a software engineering (SWE) intern on the Camera Machine Intelligence team. This is actually my first internship; the summer after my freshman year of college I stayed on Princeton's campus to work at a Princeton-based summer accelerator for startups, and the summer after my sophomore year I spent nine weeks in <a href="https://math.williams.edu/small/">the Williams College SMALL REU.</a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> Both were really great experiences that I am so grateful to have had. That being said, I did want to get some experience working a 9-to-5 at a large company before I graduated. Of course, I didn't really end up getting that experience, but the people and the work are still comparable to a certain degree.

<h3>interviewing and rejection</h3>
Interviewing is a big part of most computer science students' college lives. I had never done a real SWE interview before junior year, so it was all a really new process to me. Luckily, there are a lot of free resources to prepare online nowadays, and many schools have organizations that will offer technical interview prep for STEM roles. I interviewed with Google from September to November, and got entered in their host matching stage in late November. Google does it's interview process a little differently in that applicants are still not guaranteed an internship even after passing all the technical interviews and getting approval from the hiring committee. In order to secure an internship, applicants need to get matched with a project host in the host-matching process. This process typically lasts a couple of months, and applicants get to talk with hosts working in different areas of Google. Both the host and the intern must decide that they want to work with the other party in order for the internship to become official.

The whole process can sound stressful, and it is. I was lucky enough to get a call from my current manager a few days after I entered the intern pool. I think this is likely because I specifically listed the Pixel camera team as one that I really wanted to work on, and not many people are keen on working for the Pixel team of Google (no one really thinks "smartphones" when they think Google). However, their project was in an area I explicitly expressed interest in, and I had a little bit of computer vision background so the camera team ended up being a good match. I left the host-matching process after around two weeks. I still remember the week of anxiety between my host-matching call and the day I found out he had picked me (hosts typically interview several potential candidates before making a decision). Getting the email on that last day of the week is still one of my most memorable moments from junior fall.

Of course, this was just one internship out of nearly one hundred positions I had applied for that recruiting cycle. Before getting the Google internship, I had applied, interviewed, and gotten rejected from many other companies. I went through the finance and trading recruiting cycle earlier in the fall and barely made it out alive in most of those interviews. I had other SWE interviews where the interviewer literally stopped me after the second question because I clearly lacked the developer skills they wanted.<a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> Facing rejection repeatedly (and also during the previous two years) was really tough, especially while simultaneously handling junior year. I don't have great advice for dealing with these things, but ultimately I think it's important to accept that rejection happens to everyone, and that the only way to get something good out of the experience is to own it, see what can be improved next time, and move on.

<h3>the long wait</h3>
I was so excited throughout all of winter for the summer to come. I spent weeks planning elaborate hiking trips with my friends who were also going to be in the Bay Area, and excessively Googling previous Google interns' accounts of their internship experiences. Of course, we all know now that no one would be doing these things; instead we would all be scattered around the country calling into meetings remotely. The weeks after the official email detailing the company's decision to go virtual for the summer were filled with a lot of mixed emotions--disbelief because the internship itself didn't even seem fully real yet, frustration from the process of actually having to cancel reservations and rentals, and guilt because it was hard to feel grateful for the virtual opportunity. Eventually though, the fact that I would be spending the summer at home sank in, and the emotions were replaced with the inevitable stress of spring semester finals.

<h3>my first two weeks</h3>
On June 1st, I officially began work. Everything got off to a very slow start--the sudden transition to a virtual internship model for 4,000+ interns required a lot of last-minute logistics, and my onboarding process was affected by multiple delays. Consequently, I ended up having my first <i>real</i> day of work on the Friday of that first week. I remember being so overwhelmed that day, between trying to set up my remote workstation, running into all sorts of remote connection problems, having my first meeting with my manager, finishing a week's worth of onboarding in a day, and exploring the vast virtual expanse of online Google.

Very quickly, I learned that I knew nothing that I needed to know for my project. The thing about classes at liberal arts schools is that they have to teach you what scientists have been studying from the very beginning, starting with the most classical theoretical foundations. Industry, on the other hand, is continuously moving forward--companies don't stop and reset at the intro 101 level every fall. So when I arrived at work on my first day, it felt like the knowledge I had and the knowledge I needed had a completely empty intersection. I had no idea how to manage multi-threaded programming. I never really worried about the mechanics of buffer, caches, and disk memory in real applications. I barely even knew how to access the virtual machines set up for remote work. After my manager planned out our milestones for the summer, I felt completely drained from queueing up all the things I would have to learn more about in my mind.

Fortunately, my host was extremely understanding and accommodating, and told me about his own struggles when he first joined (even though that was over eight years ago). He pointed me to a lot of great books to read up on, and took the time to walk me through unfamiliar concepts. The rest of the team was also extremely welcoming, and while I am by far the youngest of the group, I began to understand what it meant to be treated as an adult rather than a student.

<h3>summary</h3>
I know this wasn't a very intelligable or organized post. But I wanted to get some thoughts and feelings down at these moments of confusion. My biggest takeaways from the past two weeks have been:

<ol>
<li><b>Ask questions.</b> This is obvious, everyone tells you this. But it's a lot harder when you actually begin working. Anytime I hit a problem, I would go through the entire mental process of asking myself: <i>Did I put in enough effort trying to find the solution on my own yet? Would it be annoying for me to ping my manager right now? Have I already asked too many questions today? Did he already discuss this with me earlier?</i> In the end, it's usually safer to ask anyway.</li>

<li><b>Virtual meetings are terrible.</b> I'm an aggresively advanced introvert, so meeting people has always felt unnatural for me. Meeting people <i>virtually</i> is one hundred and ten times more awkward--you can't tell when someone else is going to speak at the same time you are because of network lags, people freeze at the worst times, and ending a virtual call gracefully is an elusive art. Making friends is also extremely hard, because there's no physical commitment to sustaining the relationship. While it's great that technology lets us meet people from all across the country, it also eliminates the obligation we have to be physically present amongst a constant group of people. In a virtual world, we can opt out of interaction whenever we want to, and this definitely gives all casual conversations or meetings a facade of ingenuousness.</li>

<li><b>Learing how to learn is still important.</b> Most of my first two weeks have been spent with reading code, reading books, and writing toy code. Even learning how to navigate the environment of a big company presents its own learning curve.</li>

<li><b>People have kids.</b> This is probably the best part of WFH. It doesn't matter how old someone is, if they have a kid in the video chat, that kid is less than ten. If anything makes up for the dehumanization of social interaction that online meetings create, single-digit age children have the uncanny ability to make up for that.</li>

<li><b>Keep a personal log.</b> I typically keep a weekly running checklist of tasks I want to accomplish, and also a daily log of questions I have, action items I've finished, and meetings I've attended. On the Monday of each new week, I create a new document. Keeping track of what I did every day helps combat the unsettling feeling that I just sit at my desk for eight hours a day and accomplish nothing. I've also heard that it helps with internal evaluations at the end of the internship.</li>
</ol>

Next week I'll be moving out of the prep stage and into the ideation stage of my project. I'll be learning about API design practices and meetign with some employees outside of my immediate team. Hopefully, I'll also have some more downtime to pick back up on reading weekly papers again, and also begin Dr. Ruha Benjamin's book.

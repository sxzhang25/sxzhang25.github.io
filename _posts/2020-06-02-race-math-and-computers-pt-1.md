Originally, I had planned on continuing a survey of graphical networks this week, but instead I'm going to take some time to write down and organize all the racing thoughts I've had in the last few days. This weekend has been a painful, eye-opening, devastating week for many---some more than others. The deaths of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-georgia.html">Ahmaud Arbery,</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/breonna-taylor-police.html">Breonna Taylor,</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/george-floyd-investigation.html">George Floyd,</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/01/us/louisville-protests-man-shot-dead/index.html">David McAtee</a> are only a few identified people amongst a mass of unnamed victims of institutionalized violence in America. As an POC, woman, and first-generation American I am going to use this time to assess, reflect on, and move towards changing my internal biases, as well as figure out what I can do to actively engage in anti-racism.

I won't go into the details of these terrible incidents because I am not a journalist and there are <a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/george-floyd-protests-06-02-20/index.html">tons</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/us/george-floyd-video-autopsy-protests.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-george-floyd&variant=show&region=TOP_BANNER&context=storylines_menu">of</a> <a href="https://time.com/section/us/">resources</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/">online</a> to read and digest all the recent events. But I did want to record some of my thoughts on a deeply related and urgent problem with which I have much more direct experiences.

<h3>race in mathematics</h3>
Race and academics is one of the few issues with which I have lived in close proximity. In 2015, my school district became the center of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/26/nyregion/reforms-to-ease-students-stress-divide-a-new-jersey-school-district.html">a heated debate that largely divided along racial lines.</a> This debate did not directly touch on larger racial inequalities in America, but it did refuel some sentiments amongst Asian immigrants that Americans look down on us and seek to exclude us despite our efforts to assimilate and work hard. Much of this dialogue centers around education, particularly college admissions. A lot of my Asian American friends are familiar with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/nyregion/Black-students-nyc-high-schools.html">racial disparities found in New York's elite high schools</a> and especially the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/10/01/730386096/federal-judge-rules-in-favor-of-harvard-in-admissions-case">controversial affirmative action case between Harvard and Students For Fair Admissions (SFFA).</a> The latter example was also a large source of racial conflict between Asian and Black communities, which I think highlights a lot of race tensions felt amongst both older and younger generations of Asians in America.

In education especially, we should all be in support for the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. Whether you appeal more to anecdotal or statistical evidence, the evidence showing systemic racial inequality against Black communities is clear, and has been clear. <a href="https://nationalequityatlas.org/indicators/School_poverty/By_race~ethnicity:35576/United_States/false/Year(s):2016/School_type:All_public_schools/">In 2016, 25.1% of American public school students attended schools categorized as <i>high-poverty</i>,</a> but this number drops to 15.9% among Asian American and Pacific Islander students and 8.5% in White American students, whereas the percentage increases to 45.5% among Black students and 46.2% among Latino students.<a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> The story does not change much after high school. At Harvard University, <a href="https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/admissions-statistics">Asian Americans comprise 25.3% of the admitted class of 2023 while Black students account for only 14.3% and Hispanic or Latino students account for only 12.2%.</a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> At Princeton University, <a href="https://admission.princeton.edu/how-apply/admission-statistics">Asian Americans account for 24% of the enrolled class of 2023 while Black students and Hispanic or Latino each students account for only 7%.</a> I see these types of statistics circulated a lot, and they clearly depict a troubling picture among private educational institutions---that there are disproportionately fewer Black and Brown minority students.

It's also worth noting the statistics on the other end of the college spectrum. In 2020, <a href="https://www.aacc.nche.edu/research-trends/fast-facts/">26% of students enrolled in community colleges under the American Association of Community Colleges are Hispanic or Latino and 13% are Black, whereas 6% are Asian.</a> Community colleges are accessible and wide-reaching providers of higher education, but are able to access far fewer financial resources than private institutions. The Century Foundation reported that in the 2013 fiscal year, <a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/recommendations-providing-community-colleges-resources-need/?session=1">private four-year research institutions spent five times as much money per full-time equivalent student on average as did community colleges.</a> Money allows institutions to buy books, create studying spaces, and hire dedicated faculty. These things are integral to a quality education and oftentimes community colleges cannot provide them. In my opinion, the <a href="https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/cross-center-initiatives/state-and-local-finance-initiative/state-and-local-backgrounders/police-and-corrections-expenditures#Question1Police">billions of dollars that get spent on policing and correction</a> by local and state governments could be put to much better use funding public schools. Under the current system, <a href="http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/may02/vol59/num08/Unequal-School-Funding-in-the-United-States.aspx">the majority of public school funding comes directly from local property taxes.</a> This has led to drastic differences in education quality between wealthy and impoverished districts.

If we go one level deeper and look at specific majors within private and public four-year universities, we can find the same trends repeated and exacerbated within mathematics and computer science departments. From 2000 until 2016, <a href="https://www.mathvalues.org/masterblog/2018/7/9/departmental-turnaround-the-case-of-san-diego-state-university-3ln58-s47wz">the percentage of all bachelor's degrees awarded to Black students rose from about 9% to just over 10%, but the percentage of bachelor's degrees in mathematics awarded to Black students dropped from just over 8% to less than 5%.</a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a> The statistics among faculty is equally imbalanced---<a href="http://www.ams.org/profession/data/cbms-survey/cbms2015-Report.pdf">in 2015, the percentage of Black full-time faculty in PhD mathematics departments at four-year institutions was 1%</a><a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a> (in an even further breakdown: the percentage of Black <i>female</i> faculty is <1%). The math community has not been the quickest to act on its gender problem---but it has been even slower to address its race problem.

I know it's easy for someone like me to look up some statistics, evaluate them, and regurgitate that analysis in a few paragraphs. This isn't where I want my engagement with these issues to stop, but I think it's the best place for me to start. The tech and math community is probably one that I will be a part of for the rest of my life, and I'd like to take the long-term movement seriously.

<h3>my experiences with diversity in math</h3>

Inclusion, accessibility and belonging in math is an issue I care about immensely, because I have felt the weight of feeling alone and unbelonging many, many times throughout my time studying math. Even in my own department at school, I have consistently questioned whether I belonged; whether I <i>deserved</i> to be here. Fields of study like math, where natural talent is believed to be a strong factor in one's success, have a notorious reputation for building high barriers to entry. Especially when math departments can attract some of the most quantitatively well-versed students in a school, any "non-prodigy" might feel discouraged at times. But I think there are bigger issues that this guise of academic rigor can hide, especially in terms of representation and accessibility. I dont't want to speak for anyone else, but if I---someone who has had years of access to additional academic resources and experience with mathematics competitions---am inclined to occasionally feel left behind by members of a community in which my non-male peers are grossly underrepresented but my Asian peers are well-represented, then how would a Black student feel in the same space? How would a Black non-male student feel? 

Representation is important, and for me personally, representation has gotten me through numerous academic hardships. I've had my fair share of struggles and imposter syndrome here at the Princeton math department, but being able to easily connect to my peers who have similar backgrounds as me has ultimately helped me persevere. At least in terms of my racial identity, there's no reason to "prove" that I belong, which is a phrase I've heard and read in a lot of stories about Black racial tokenization. To put it bluntly, the math community can do better in so many ways. Diversity of both race and gender has long been a problem in math, and there is no reason why these problems should continue. I myself have continued to buy into some of the stereotypes that perpetuate this inequality, and having taken more classes outside of the math classes this past year has given me time and space to address those biases. I definitely don't know everything about the origins and causes of these disparaties, but I think I can make a much better effort at doing so. Next year I will be a senior, and I want to use my remaining time in Princeton to get more involved in the math department's outreach to underclassmen.

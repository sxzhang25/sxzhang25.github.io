Last week I had planned on continuing a survey of graphical networks. This week, it's become clear that I will have to reprioritize for the time being. This weekend has been a painful, eye-opening, devastating week for many communities--some more than others. The deaths of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-georgia.html">Ahmaud Arbery,</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/breonna-taylor-police.html">Breonna Taylor,</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/george-floyd-investigation.html">George Floyd,</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/01/us/louisville-protests-man-shot-dead/index.html">David McAtee</a> are only a few identified humans in a mass of unnamed victims of institutionalized violence in America. As an Asian American, woman, and first-generation American I am going to use this time to assess, reflect on, and correct my internal biases, as well as figure out what I can do to actively engage in anti-racism.

<!--excerpt-->

I won't go into the details of these terrible incidents because I am not a journalist and there are <a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/george-floyd-protests-06-02-20/index.html">tons</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/us/george-floyd-video-autopsy-protests.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-george-floyd&variant=show&region=TOP_BANNER&context=storylines_menu">of</a> <a href="https://time.com/section/us/">resources</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/">online</a> to read and digest all the recent events. Instead, I'm going to acknowledge my background as an Asian American first-generation immigrant woman studying math and computer science in the United States' private education system, and understand how my role as a person of color (POC) affects the status of my own community and other minority communities in the USA. My goal is to finally start dedicating conscious and continued effort on racial issues in America, something that I should have begun doing a long, long time ago.

<h3>how we come to be complicit</h3>
I grew up in an upper-middle and middle class suburb in Central Jersey. I lived and still live in a town ten minutes away from Princeton University, where I currently attend school. My parents immigrated from China in the late 90's to study in America and find "the American Dream." When I described myself in college applications, I split my identity into three main portions: art, math, and swimming. 

From this short description of myself, I see how clearly privileged and undisturbed my upbringing was, even though I never considered myself wealthy or socially advantaged as a child. Privilege was something my family never discussed--we were immigrants, so our life in America was contingent on working hard to build ourselves up from scratch. The narrative is painfully familiar to many of us Asian Americans: study hard--get good grades in school--become a doctor, lawyer, or engineer--and you will live a good life (it is, however, important to note that there are many Asians in America who also live in under-resourced communities but that is a separate discussion in its own right). This step-by-step guide to life never taught us to pay attention to the preexisting conditions in America that supported our work, nor did it motivate us to look beyond our own communities and participate in the larger social fabric of our country. As a result, I and many of my friends forgot about the importance of political participation. Instead, we silently enjoyed the benefits of the other people's activism and discourse. This is how I came to be complicit, not only in anti-Black racism but racism in general.

Since I have never lived in a disadvantaged or underprivileged community, I cannot pretend I understand the problems and injustices faced in those communities. However, I can speak to the shortcomings of communities I am actively involved in--namely, academia in math and computer science, and the Chinese American experience. I hope that I can use my observations in these contexts to to better understand what I can do to combat anti-Black, anti-Asian and general anti-POC racism.

<h3>race in mathematics</h3>
Race and academics is one of the few issues with which I have lived in close proximity. In 2015, my school district became the center of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/26/nyregion/reforms-to-ease-students-stress-divide-a-new-jersey-school-district.html">a heated debate that largely divided along racial lines.</a> This debate did not directly touch on larger racial inequalities in America, but it did refuel some sentiments amongst Asian immigrants that Americans look down on us and seek to exclude us despite our efforts to assimilate and work hard. Much of this dialogue centers around education, particularly college admissions. Nearly all Asian Americans I know are deeply familiar with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/nyregion/Black-students-nyc-high-schools.html">racial disparities found in New York's elite high schools</a> and especially the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/10/01/730386096/federal-judge-rules-in-favor-of-harvard-in-admissions-case">controversial affirmative action case between Harvard and Students For Fair Admissions (SFFA).</a> In fact, the latter example was also a large source of racial conflict between Asian and Black communities, highlighting the deeply ingrained anti-Black feelings harbored in older and younger Asian generations.

We should all be voicing our support for the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. Whether you appeal more to anecdotal or statistical evidence, the evidence showing systemic racial inequality against Black communities is clear, and has been clear. A common issue amongst Asian Americans is a feeling that the BLM movement marginalizes Asian American discrimination. It is important to emphasize that supporting the BLM movement is <i>not</i> a statement that Asian lives <i>don't</i> matter. I strongly believe that Asian immigrants<a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> are some of the hardest workers in America, and that the sacrifices made by Asian immigrants is indescribable and invaluable towards society. There are a lot of upper class and upper-middle class Asian Americans who worked extremely hard to go from next to nothing to financial stability. However, it is undeniable that our ability to do so is strongly linked to our subscription to and affection for <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2017/04/19/524571669/model-minority-myth-again-used-as-a-racial-wedge-between-asians-and-Blacks">the "model minority" myth created by White Americans.</a> In the process of aligning ourselves with this misconception, we lose sight of the real problem: wide-spread systemic racism, mainly directed towards Black people in America. One particular issue that we often fail to recognize is a problem within the American education system: <b>educational poverty tends to split along White/Asian and non-Asian POC racial lines.</b>

The numbers are unmistakeable. <a href="https://nationalequityatlas.org/indicators/School_poverty/By_race~ethnicity:35576/United_States/false/Year(s):2016/School_type:All_public_schools/">In 2016, 25.1% of American public school students attended schools categorized as <i>high-poverty</i>,</a> but this number drops to 15.9% among Asian American and Pacific Islander students and 8.5% in White American students, whereas the percentage increases to 45.5% among Black students and 46.2% among Latino students.<a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> The story does not change much after high school. At Harvard University, <a href="https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/admissions-statistics">Asian Americans comprise 25.3% of the admitted class of 2023 while Black students account for only 14.3% and Hispanic or Latino students account for only 12.2%.</a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> At Princeton University, <a href="https://admission.princeton.edu/how-apply/admission-statistics">Asian Americans account for 24% of the enrolled class of 2023 while Black students and Hispanic or Latino each students account for only 7%.</a> I see these types of statistics circulated a lot, and they clearly depict a troubling picture among private educational institutions. The problem is <i>not</i> that there are too many Asian students; it's that there are disproportionately fewer non-Asian minority students.

It's also worth noting the statistics on the other end of the college spectrum. In 2020, <a href="https://www.aacc.nche.edu/research-trends/fast-facts/">26% of students enrolled in community colleges under the American Association of Community Colleges are Hispanic or Latino and 13% are Black, whereas 6% are Asian.</a> Community colleges are accessible and wide-reaching providers of higher education, but are able to access far fewer financial resources than private institutions. The Century Foundation reported that in the 2013 fiscal year, <a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/recommendations-providing-community-colleges-resources-need/?session=1">private four-year research institutions spent five times as much money per full-time equivalent student on average as did community colleges.</a> Money allows institutions to buy books, create studying spaces, and hire dedicated faculty. These things are integral to a quality education and oftentimes community colleges cannot provide them. In my opinion, the <a href="https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/cross-center-initiatives/state-and-local-finance-initiative/state-and-local-backgrounders/police-and-corrections-expenditures#Question1Police">billions of dollars that get spent on policing and correction</a> by local and state governments could be put to much better use funding public schools. Under the current system, <a href="http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/may02/vol59/num08/Unequal-School-Funding-in-the-United-States.aspx">the majority of public school funding comes directly from local property taxes.</a> This has led to drastic differences in education quality between wealthy and impoverished districts.

If we go one level deeper and look at specific majors within private and public four-year universities, we can find the same trends repeated and exacerbated within mathematics and computer science departments. From 2000 until 2016, <a href="https://www.mathvalues.org/masterblog/2018/7/9/departmental-turnaround-the-case-of-san-diego-state-university-3ln58-s47wz">the percentage of all bachelor's degrees awarded to Black students rose from about 9% to just over 10%, but the percentage of bachelor's degrees in mathematics awarded to Black students dropped from just over 8% to less than 5%.</a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a> The statistics among faculty is equally imbalanced--<a href="http://www.ams.org/profession/data/cbms-survey/cbms2015-Report.pdf">in 2015, the percentage of Black full-time faculty in PhD mathematics departments at four-year institutions was 1%</a><a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a> (in an even further breakdown: the percentage of Black <i>female</i> faculty is <1%). The math community has always been slow to recognize its gender problem--but it has been even slower to recognize its race problem.

<h3>my experiences with diversity in math</h3>

I will now attempt to consider some personal experiences (hopefully without shifting focus of the overall narrative to myself). I do not know any Black math majors at Princeton University--this <i>does not</i> mean there have never been any. I do, however, know a couple Black students at Princeton who considered majoring in math. The first is a friend who actually declared as a math major during sophomore year, but switched into the philosophy department during her junior year. I first met her at a lunch promoting the participation of women in math. We both took Advanced Graph Theory during the fall semester of my junior year and worked together on our problem sets. Clearly she could understand and learn the material with no problem, but her decision to switch ultimately had more to do with how she felt in the math community at Princeton. For her, being a math major was less desirable than being a philosophy major who went out of her way to take additional math classes. I'm sure there were other, non-math related reasons for the switch, but to say that it was entirely an intellectually-motivated decision would be false. 

The other student was a sophomore who I tutored in MAT 215 Honors Single Variable Analysis--the iconic introductory class for Princeton math majors. This class is notorious for being a lot of work, requiring a lot of time, and being an all-around rewarding class. At the time, he was deciding between math, physics (respect) and music, but ultimately he told me that math wasn't for him. I didn't try to push him into reconsidering (I am a firm believer that being a math major at without being 100% emotionally invested is a huge mistake), but I did feel a little sad. I felt like I had failed in some ways, although I know it wasn't my job to decide what other people should choose as their major.<a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a> He never told me in detail how he reached his decision, but we had many conversations about feelings of discouragment while studying math. Princeton, after all, attracts some of the top-ranked students <i>internationally</i> to its math department, which is not at all a problem in itself but can foster a great deal of imposter syndrome in other students.

Though my sample size is small, in comparing my Black peers' experiences with my own I can sense that there is a difference in how they are welcomed by the department. While I also occasionally feel inadequate and discouraged by the math department, I have still been able to find numerous reasons to stay. Perhaps there are other pressures in my Asian identity that prevent me from having the courage to leave, but ultimately I attribute my persistence to the friends I've made in the math community, many of who look like me and have similar backgrounds as me. In terms of my ethnicity, there's no reason to "prove" that I belong, which is a phrase I've heard and read in a lot of stories about Black racial tokenization. To put it bluntly, the math community can do better in so many ways. Diversity of both race and gender has long been a problem in math, and there is absolutely no reason why these problems should continue. I myself have continued to buy into some of the stereotypes that perpetuate this inequality, and distancing myself from the math department this past year has given me time and space to address those biases. I definitely don't know everything about the origins and causes of these disparaties, but I think I can make a much better effort at doing so. Next year I will be a senior, and I want to use my remaining time in Princeton to get more involved in the math department's outreach to underclassmen.

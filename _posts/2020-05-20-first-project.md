In an effort to continue my learning in computer vision, pure/applied math, etc. as well as keep track of my first summer interning in tech, I'm going to try keeping a weekly blog. Topics I want to touch on include: summaries of papers I read, interesting things I learn while coding, and miscellaneous fascinations.

To set the scene, at the risk of sounding dramatic: I've just finished my junior year at Princeton University, a quarter of which was spent learning remotely from home. The world is in the midst of a global pandemic. The US is preparing for a recession, and the number of unemployed persons surpassed 23.1 million in April, with no signs of decreasing soon. Joe Biden is the Democratic candidate against President Donald Trump in the upcoming election later this year.

I am preparing to work from home for my internship at Google with the Pixel camera team. Originally, I was slated to work in Google's Mountain View headquarters in Silicon Valley. Luckily, the program was converted into a virtual structure rather than axed completely. I have no idea what this summer is going to be like, and neither do most other college students.

In an effort to continue my learning in computer vision, pure/applied math, etc. as well as keep track of my first summer interning in tech, I'm going to try keeping a weekly blog. Topics I want to touch on include: summaries of papers I read, interesting things I learn while coding, and occasional miscellaneous fascinations.

To set the scene (albeit at the risk of sounding dramatic): I've just finished my junior year at Princeton University, a quarter of which was spent learning remotely from home. The world is in the midst of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-maps-and-cases/">a coronavirus pandemic;</a> specifically, one caused by the COVID-19 virus. The US and many other countries around the world are preparing for a recession, <a href="https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000">and the US unemployment rate hit a record 14.7% in April.</a> Here in New Jersey, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/new-jersey-coronavirus-cases.html">over 10,000 coronavirus-related deaths have been reported</a>; that's nowhere near the numbers in New York. It's an election year, and Joe Biden is the Democratic nominee who will be running against President Donald Trump later this year.

I am preparing to work from home for my internship at Google with the Pixel camera team. Originally, I was slated to work in Google's Mountain View headquarters in Silicon Valley. Luckily, the program was converted into a virtual structure <a href="https://ismyinternshipcancelled.com/">rather than axed completely.</a> I have no idea what this summer is going to be like, and neither do most other college students.

Despite this, I am hopeful. I am excited to start work in June, and I'm looking forward to having a couple of extra hours to spend each day. In the past, summers have been the best months of my year, and I am eager to see what this one has in store.

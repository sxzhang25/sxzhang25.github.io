In an effort to continue my learning in computer vision, pure/applied math, etc. as well as keep track of my first summer interning in tech, I'm going to try keeping a weekly blog. Topics I want to touch on include: summaries of papers I read, interesting things I learn while coding, and miscellaneous fascinations.

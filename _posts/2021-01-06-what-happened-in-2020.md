As the new year approached and passed, I didn't feel in the mood to write a proper reflection on the old year. But recently, I realized that I tend to forget a lot of events that happen in my life, like what I did last week or even what I had for breakfast yesterday. Many of the things that gradually slip out of my mind are actually things I would really like to remember. So instead of a reflection, I've decided to make a timeline of the past year--a mix of personal, national and global events that I remember most clearly. Besides verifying some of the more high-profile events were verified against news sources, the rest are all pulled from calendars, emails and photos.

<!--excerpt-->

There isn't really any criteria for what makes it onto the list other than the fact that I still remember it. Certain things will surely get left out just by that virtue, which I unfortunately can't amend too much at this point. There's <a href="https://www.livescience.com/24836-mystery-memory-recall.html">a theory in neuroscience</a> that memories are vulnerable to being overwritten every time we recall them, and this phenomenon occurs more often as we grow older. Perhaps my motivation for recording these things is simply to preserve some degree of consistency and integrity to my life. Or maybe I'm just procrastinating (more likely the case).

...and that brings us to 2021. After having completed my first fully virtual semester of college, I'm now two weeks away from moving back to Princeton for my first isolated on-campus semester and my last semester of... well, college. Saying I'm optimistic or even excited for the year ahead wouldn't be completely honest, but I do think I'm ready. I think this year will still be as "unprecedented" as last year was, but hopefully in better ways.

<p>Things that don't quite belong on any of the other pages.</p>

<h3>recent reads</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom:35px;">Like most people, I'm trying to become a more consistent reader. These are some recent favorites.</p>
<ul>
    <li><p><b><i>Born a Crime</i> by Trevor Noah.</b> A memoir by my favorite comedian that I wish I could read for the first time again.</p></li>
    <li><p><b><i>The Color Purple</i> by Alice Walker.</b> One of my favorite historical fiction stories, centered on the lives of Black women in the early 20th century.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>future</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom:35px;">What I would like to add to this site in subsequent versions.</p>
<ul>
    <li>A <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">now page</a> for better updates.</li>
    <li>Dark/light mode toggling. I think dark mode is overrated, but still nice to have.</li>
    <li><strike>Reading time estimates for blog posts.</strike></li>
    <li>Convert to a serif-based typographic theme. I love a good sans-serif design, but I enjoy writing in serif types more.</li>
</ul>
